# Recommendation System using Flask

This project implements a simple recommendation system using Flask. The system recommends items to users based on a specific algorithm, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface to interact with the recommendation system.
- Support for different recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative, content-based).
- Simple API endpoint for generating recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8** (or higher)
- **Flask** for building the web application
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system-flask.git
   cd recommendation-system-flask
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Open the application in your browser**:
   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the recommendation system.

## Files Explanation

### `app.py`

This is the main file for the Flask application. It sets up routes for the web pages and API endpoints. You can customize the recommendation logic in this file.

### `requirements.txt`

Contains all dependencies required for this project:
   - `flask` - For building the web application.
   - `pandas` - For handling data and data structures.
   - `numpy` - For numerical operations.

Install these dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### `templates/index.html`

The front-end interface where users can input their preferences or search for recommendations. This is a simple HTML file styled with CSS.

### `data/items.csv`

This file includes sample data that the recommendation system uses. You can replace it with your data to customize the recommendations.

## Customizing the Recommendation Algorithm

You can modify the recommendation algorithm inside `app.py`. For example, you might use:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend items based on the user's past behavior and similar users.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend items based on item similarity with the user's past preferences.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine collaborative and content-based techniques for improved accuracy.

## Example Usage

To test the recommendation system, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Input your preferences, and click "Recommend" to see the results.
